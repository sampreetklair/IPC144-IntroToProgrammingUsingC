### POINTS TO NOTE
- WS3 contains some errors and doesn't give the expected output. Due to this I couldn't submit it on time so left it incomplete.
- MS2 works for the submission but has some functions which should have more validations. I added those validations in MS3 but they are still not there in MS2.

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
